# CS6013-IIT_Hyd-Advanced-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This contains selected assignments from CS6013 - Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms at IIT Hyderabad, July-Dec 2021

They include :

1. Implement the divide and conquer algorithm for the "Closest-Points Problem" outlined in Section 10.2.2 (page 470) of the book "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ (DSAAC)", by MARK ALLEN WEISS. This algorithm, given N points, finds a closest pair of points in O(N logN) time. The code for a MERGE SORT algorithm has to be implemented from scratch for sorting purposes.

2. 
(A) Write an O(n log n)-time HEAPSORT sorting algorithm (do not use any built-in library function)
to sort the array m1;m2; . . .  ;mn in a non-decreasing order.

(B) DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING for maximizing the no of points by preparing dishes with minimum time & maximum points

3. Miller Rabin Test for Primality Testing
