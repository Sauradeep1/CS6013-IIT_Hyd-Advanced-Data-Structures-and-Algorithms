# CS6013-IIT_Hyd-Advanced-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This contains selected assignments from CS6013 - Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms at IIT Hyderabad, July-Dec 2021

They include :

1. Implement the divide and conquer algorithm for the "Closest-Points Problem" outlined in Section 10.2.2 (page 470) of the book "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ (DSAAC)", by MARK ALLEN WEISS. This algorithm, given N points, finds a closest pair of points in O(N logN) time. The code for a MERGE SORT algorithm has to be implemented from scratch for sorting purposes.
